# Interop-REST-Mail-Contacts-Calendar-Sample 

Office Interoperability Examples - REST Mail, Contacts, and Calendar App

This example app demonstrates the Representational State Transfer (REST) interface for Office 365, including authentication, interacting with the calendar, querying the address book, and sending email. 

In the app, after you log into an Office 365 account, you can create single and recurring meetings on a calendar. Meetings can be scheduled with a given location, time slot, and a set of invitees, where the available locations and attendees are queried from Office 365. Each invitee has the option to accept, decline, or tentatively accept a meeting, or to email the organizer. An organizer has the option to reply all or forward the meeting invitation, and to send a "running late" message to the invitees.
